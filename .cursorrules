Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

Naming Conventions:

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

TypeScript Usage:

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

Syntax and Formatting:

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX

Error Handling and Validation:

- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Use Zod for form validation
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors

UI and Styling:

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach

Performance Optimization:

- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading

Key Conventions:

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)


Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. Use pnpm for package management.


For Python, use the following:

- Use Pydantic for data validation and parsing
- Use SQLModel for database models
- Use FastAPI for the API
- Use SQLAlchemy for the database
- Use Pytest for testing
- Use uv for package management
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use Pydantic v2 for data validation and parsing
